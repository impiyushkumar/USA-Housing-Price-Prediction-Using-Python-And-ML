# USA Housing Price Prediction Using Python And ML

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting housing prices in the USA based on various features using linear regression. The dataset used, `USA_Housing.csv`, contains information such as average area income, house age, number of rooms, number of bedrooms, and area population.

## Data Exploration
The project involves extensive data exploration and visualization using libraries like `seaborn` and `matplotlib`. Key visualizations include:
- **Pairplot**: To visualize relationships between features.
- **Violin Plot**: To show the distribution of house prices.
- **Displot**: To understand the distribution of a specific feature.

## Linear Regression Model
The project implements a linear regression model to predict house prices. Key coefficients from the model include:
- **Avg. Area Income**
- **Avg. Area House Age**
- **Avg. Area Number of Rooms**
- **Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms**
- **Area Population**

### Model Evaluation
Predictions are made using the test dataset, and the results are visualized with a scatter plot comparing actual vs. predicted prices.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required libraries.
3. Load the dataset and run the script to generate visualizations and predictions.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of data analysis and machine learning techniques to predict housing prices, providing valuable insights for stakeholders in the real estate market.
